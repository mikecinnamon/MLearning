# [ML-10]  Example - Direct marketing of term deposits

## Introduction

There are two main approaches for companies to promote products and/or services: through **mass campaigns**, targeting a general indiscriminate public, or through **direct marketing**, targeting a specific set of contacts. Nowadays, in a global competitive world, positive responses to mass campaigns are typically very low. Alternatively, direct marketing focuses on targets that assumably will be keener to that specific product/service, making these campaigns more efficient. But the increasingly vast number of marketing campaigns has reduced their effect on the general public. Furthermore, economical pressures and competition has led marketing managers to invest on direct campaigns with a strict and rigorous selection of contacts.

Ten years ago, due to the internal competition and the current financial crisis, there were huge pressures for European banks to increase their financial assets. One strategy is to offer attractive **long-term deposit** applications with good interest rates, in particular through direct marketing. A Portuguese institution had been offering term deposits to its clients for the last two years, but in a way that the board finds disorganized and inefficient. It looked as if too many contacts were made, for the subscriptions obtained.

A Portuguese bank had been using its own contact-center to carry out direct marketing campaigns. The telephone was the dominant marketing channel, although sometimes with an auxiliary use of the Internet online banking channel (*e.g*. by showing information to a specific targeted client). Furthermore, each campaign was managed in an integrated fashion and the results for all channels were outputted together.

The manager in charge of the next campaign was expected to optimize the effort. His objective was to find a **predictive model**, based on data of the preceding campaign, for the success of a contact, *i.e*. whether the client subscribes the deposit. That model would increase the campaign's efficiency by identifying the main characteristics that affected success, helping in a better management of the available resources (*e.g*. human effort, phone calls and time) and the selection of a high quality and affordable set of potential clients. To be useful for the direct campaign, a predictive model must allow reducing the number of calls in a relevant way without losing a relevant number of subscribers.

## The data set

The data for this example come from the previous phone campaign of the bank, which involved a total of 45,211 contacts. During that campaign, an attractive long-term deposit application, with good interest rates, was offered. The contacts led to 5,289 subscriptions, a 11.7% **conversion rate**.

The data set combines demographic data with data about the interaction of the client and the bank. Some of the categorical variables (the type of job, the marital status, etc) have been transformed into **dummy variables** (1/0) so they can enter an equation:

* The client's account number (`accnum`).

* The client's  age in years (`age`).

* The client's type of job (`job`). The values are 'admin', 'blue-collar', 'entrepreneur', 'housemaid', 'management', 'retired', 'self-employed', 'student', 'technician', 'unknown' and 'unemployed'. Converted to twelve dummies.

* The client's marital status (`marital`). The values are 'married', 'divorced' and 'single'. Converted to three dummies.

* The client's education level (`education`). The values are 'unknown', 'secondary', 'primary' and 'tertiary'. Converted to four dummies.

* Whether the client had credit in default (`default`). The values are 'yes' and 'no'. Converted to a dummy (1 for 'yes' and 0 for 'no').

* The client's average yearly balance in euros (`balance`).

* Whether the client had a housing loan (`housing`). The values are 'yes' and 'no'. Converted to a dummy (1 for 'yes' and 0 for 'no').

* Whether the client had a personal loan (`loan`). The values are 'yes' and 'no'. Converted to a dummy (1 for 'yes' and 0 for 'no').

* The usual communication channel with the client (`contact`). The values are 'unknown', 'telephone' and 'cellular'. Converted to three dummies.

* The duration of the last contact with the client before the campaign in seconds (`duration`). 

* The number of days passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (`pdays`). The entry is -1 when the client had not been previously contacted.

* The number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (`previous`).

* OThe outcome of the previous marketing campaign with the client (`poutcome`). The values are 'unknown', 'other', 'failure' and 'success'. Converted to four dummies.

* Whether the client had subscribed a term deposit (`deposit`). The values are 'yes' and 'no'. Converted to a dummy (1 for 'yes' and 0 for 'no'). This is the target of the predictive model to be developed.

## Questions

Q1. Develop a **logistic regression model** to predict the response to the campaign (`deposit`) from the other variables.

Q2. Use your model to assign, to every client, a **predictive score** for suscribing the deposit. How is the distribution of the scores? Is it different for the subscribers and the non-subscribers?

Q3. Set a **threshold** for the scores to adequate the model to your business purpose.

Q4. Based on your model, if a **target** of 4,000 subscriptions has been set, how many calls would be needed to hit the target?

Q5. Setting a **budget** of 10,000 calls, how would you select the clients to be called? How many subscriptions would be achieved?

## Importing the data

As in the preceding examples, we use the Pandas funcion `read_csv()` to import the data from a GitHub repository. In this case, we take the column `accnum` as the index (`index_col=0`).

```
In [1]: import pandas as pd
   ...: path = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikecinnamon/Data/main/'
   ...: df = pd.read_csv(path + 'deposit.csv', index_col=0)
```

## Exploring the data

We print a report of the content of `df` with the method `.info()`. Everything comes as expected, so far. There are no missing values.

```

[5 rows x 35 columns]
```

Finally, we check the conversion rate:

```
In [4]: df['deposit'].mean().round(3)
Out[4]: 0.117
```

*Note*. The value -1 in the column `pdays`, when a client has not been previously contacted, may look strange, but it is irrelevant in this case, since this situation is covered by the dummy `poutcome_unknown`. It can be proved, with a bit of algebra, that replacing the imputed value -1 by a different choice would lead to a model with exactly the same predicted values.

## Q1. Logistic regression model

We create a target vector and a feature matrix. The target vector is the last column (`deposit`) and the feature matrix integrates the other columns.

```
In [5]: y = df['deposit']
   ...: X = df.drop(columns='deposit')
```

To develop our logistic regression model with scikit-learn, we instantiate an estimator from the class `LogisticRegression()`, from the subpackage `linear_model`, applying the method `.fit()` as in example ML-06. We also increase here the maximum number of iterations. 

```
In [6]: from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
   ...: clf = LogisticRegression(max_iter=2000)
   ...: clf.fit(X, y)
Out[6]: LogisticRegression(max_iter=2000)
```

The default predictions and the corresponding confusion matrix are obtained as in example ML-06. We use here (for a change) the Pandas function `crosstab()`. 

```
In [7]: y_pred = clf.predict(X)
   ...: conf = pd.crosstab(y, y_pred)
   ...: conf
Out[7]: 
col_0        0     1
deposit             
0        38968   954
1         3570  1719
```

On one side, these results look fine, since, using this model, we will call only 2,673 clients, capturing 1,719 subscriptions (64.3% conversion rate). On the other side, we are missing 3,570 potential subscribers (70.9%). The total accuracy can be extracted from the confusion matrix, or calculated directly:

```
In [8]: acc = (y == y_pred).mean().round(3)
```

The accuracies on the two groups are: 

```
In [9]: acc1 = y_pred[y == 1].mean().round(3)
   ...: acc0 = (1 - y_pred[y == 0]).mean().round(3)
```

We can print them together as:

```
In [10]: acc, acc1, acc0
Out[10]: (0.9, 0.325, 0.976)
```

So, we have a very high accuracy on the negative group, but a very poor accuracy on the positive group. This is typical of imbalanced training data. Let us see how this may change if we use the predictive scores. 

## Q2. Predictive scores

The predictive scores come as the second column of the 2D array returned by the method `.predict_proba()`. We add them to the current data set.

```
In [11]: df['score'] = clf.predict_proba(X)[:, 1]
```

```
In [12]: df[['deposit', 'score']]
Out[12]: 
            deposit     score
accnum                       
2065031284        0  0.020247
2051283096        0  0.012138
2029034586        0  0.003953
2070859436        0  0.008954
2098635102        0  0.050026
...             ...       ...
2027086314        1  0.699955
2028473156        1  0.344148
2026897134        1  0.992496
2091483260        0  0.194690
2086934257        0  0.261455
```

On average, the scores are correct, and have a skewed distribution (nothing wrong with this).

```
In [13]: df['score'].describe()
Out[13]: 
count    45211.000000
mean         0.118695
std          0.179120
min          0.001720

75%          0.118823
max          1.000000
Name: score, dtype: float64
```

We can have a better view with separate histograms. The code has already been used in example ML-06.

```
In [14]: from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    ...: # Set the size of the figure
    ...: plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))
    ...: # First subplot
    ...: plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
    ...: plt.hist(df['score'][y == 1], color='gray', edgecolor='white')
    ...: plt.title('Figure 1.a. Scores (subscribers)')
    ...: plt.xlabel('Subscription score')
    ...: # Second subplot
    ...: plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
    ...: plt.hist(df['score'][y == 0], color='gray', edgecolor='white')
    ...: plt.title('Figure 1.b. Scores (non-subscribers)')
    ...: plt.xlabel('Subscription score');
```

![](https://github.com/mikecinnamon/MLearning/blob/main/Figures/10-1.png)

These figures show what is wrong with the threshold 0.5. In order to capture at least 2/3 of the potential subscribers, we have to set the threshold within the range 10-20%.

## Q3. Set a threshold for the scores

Let us take the actual conversion rate (rounded) as the threshold.

```
In [15]: y_pred = (df['score'] > 0.11).astype(int)
```

The  new confusion matrix is:

```
In [16]: conf = pd.crosstab(y, y_pred)
    ...: conf
Out[16]: 
score        0     1
deposit             
0        32696  7226
1         1022  4267
```

We would now call 11,493 clients, getting 4,267 subscriptions (a 37.1% conversion rate), which represents 4/5 of the potential subscriptions. The accuracies are now similar for the two groups:

```
In [17]: acc = (y == y_pred).mean().round(3)
    ...: acc1 = y_pred[y == 1].mean().round(3)
    ...: acc0 = (1 - y_pred[y == 0]).mean().round(3)
    ...: acc, acc1, acc0
Out[17]: (0.818, 0.807, 0.819)
```

## Q4. Target of 4,000 subscriptions

The manager can decide that he does not need to worry about the threshold once he has the scores. He can set a target of a reasonable number of subscriptions and use the scores to select the clients to be contacted. This can be managed easily in a spreadsheet, though we continue here with Python.

We would sort the data by the scores, in descending order:

```
In [18]: df = df.sort_values('score', ascending=False)
    ...: df[['deposit', 'score']]
Out[18]: 
            deposit     score
accnum                       
2084617209        0  1.000000
2054970681        0  0.999984
2096318570        1  0.999983
2064903718        0  0.999963
2078910432        0  0.999958
...             ...       ...
2038624917        0  0.002003
2041538627        0  0.001960
2037089126        0  0.001908
2009467351        0  0.001746
2024137560        0  0.001720

[45211 rows x 2 columns]
```

Then, the bank would start contacting the top scored clients, until getting the desired 4,000 subscriptions. This could be controlled by adding a column with the cumulative number of subscriptions, which can be created with the method `.cumsum()`.

```
In [19]: df['cum_subscription'] = df['deposit'].cumsum()
    ...: df[['deposit', 'score', 'cum_subscription']]
Out[19]: 
            deposit     score  cum_subscription
accnum                                         
2084617209        0  1.000000                 0
2096318570        1  0.999990                 1
2054970681        0  0.999987                 1
2064903718        0  0.999972                 1
2078910432        0  0.999970                 1
...             ...       ...               ...
2064928371        0  0.002513              5289
2038624917        0  0.002434              5289
2032496851        0  0.002398              5289
2024137560        0  0.002370              5289
2009467351        0  0.002308              5289

[45211 rows x 3 columns]
```

The first row in which the column `cum_subscription` attains the target value 40,000 corresponds to the last client contacted. In total, 9,788 clients would be contacted.

```
In [20]: (df['cum_subscription'] < 4000).sum() + 1
Out[20]: 9788
```

## Q5. Budget of 10,000 calls

Suppose now that, instead of setting an objective, the budget for the campaign allows for a certain number of contacts , for instance 10,000. We would pick then the first 10,000 rows of the data set. The account numbers of the selected clients are provided by the index labels:

```
In [21]: call_list = df.index[:10000]
    ...: call_list
Out[21]: 
Int64Index([2084617209, 2096318570, 2054970681, 2064903718, 2078910432,
            2041730862, 2071098526, 2037940512, 2032450716, 2095471620,
            ...
            2084203519, 2052019348, 2095170348, 2073864012, 2036520178,
            2072640359, 2057328940, 2079536840, 2082357614, 2051370426],
           dtype='int64', name='accnum', length=10000)
```

The last of these account numbers would be the label `call_list[9999]` (2051370426). The number of subscriptions achieved is now: 

```
In [22]: df['cum_subscription'][call_list[9999]]
Out[22]: 4031
```

## Homework

1. **Undersample** the data, by randomly dropping as many negative units as needed to match the positive units, so that you end up with a pefectly balanced training data set. Train a logistic regression model on this undersampled training data set and evaluate it, based on a confusion matrix. 

2. **Oversample** the data, by randomly adding as many duplicates of the positive units as needed to match the negative units, so that you end up with a pefectly balanced training data set. Train a logistic regression model on this oversampled training data set and evaluate it, based on a confusion matrix.

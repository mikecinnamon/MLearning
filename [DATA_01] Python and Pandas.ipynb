        "**Python** is a programming language, born in 1991. The latest stable version (when this is being written) is Python 3.14.

For instance, to examine the variation of the stock price of a specific company, or the structure of the vacation rental market in a specific region. Either for developing a program, which always involves a bit of trial and error, or in a data analysis, we use a basic tool, the **Python interactive interpreter**. We can have several instances of the interpreter, called **kernels**, running independently in our computer. To deal with the Python interpreter, Pythonistas use an app that provides an as interface to the Python interpreter, chosen among the many available choices (see below)."

Anaconda provides all the packages used in this course, so no extra installation is needed. Anyway, Anaconda has a specific package manager, called `conda`. You may need `conda` for more advanced work, because it reviews the packages that are already installed in our computer, keeping track of the dependencies, and solving version conflicts between packages. On the downside, `conda` is much slower than `pip`.\n",

First, you have **Jupyter Qt Console**, which is a shell-like app with some extra features. Jupyter (Julia/Python/R) is a new name for an older project called **IPython** (Interactive Python). IPython's contribution was the IPython shell, which added some features to the mere Python language.

For instance, `%cd` allows you to change the **working directory**. These commands *are not part of Python*. Though some textbooks and tutorials are still very keen on magic commands, these commands appear very briefly in this course. To get more information about them, enter `%quickref` in the console. Although, in practice, you can omit the percentage sign (so `%cd` works exactly the same as `cd`), it is always safer to keep using it to distinguish the magic commands from the Python code.\n",

A notebook is stored in a file with extension `ipynb` (IPython notebook). In the notebook arena, **Jupyter Notebook** is the leading choice. Notebooks are multilingual, that is, they can be used, not only with Python, but also with other languages like R.

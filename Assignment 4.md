# Assignment 4

## Introduction

This assignment is a continuation of the analysis performed in example ML-23, which uses **kake news data**. In the assignment we explore this a bit more, trying alternative approaches. 

## Questions

Q1. Use a train/test split to validate our logistic regression model. 

Q2. Train an MLP model, with one hidden layer, to the title data. Do you get better results than with the logistic regression model?

Q3. The embedding model suggested in the `sentence_transformers` website and many other sources) is `all-mpnet-base-v2`. This is the current version of a model called **MPNet** published in 2020 by a Microsoft research team. Try it with the title data. The embedding dimension is 768, so you can expect to improve the current results, and to face a slower encoding process. Also, this model will be downloaded to your computer the first time that you use it, as it happened with the encoder used in the example.

## Submission

1. Submit, through Blackboard, a readable and printable report responding these questions and explaining what you have done, including Python input and output. This can be a Word document, a PDF document or a Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`).

2. Put your name on top of the document.

## Deadline

December 1 (Sunday), 24:00.
